I built the faux wall behind desk from 2x4 lumber into 2 panels each 36" tall x 49" wide with a stud down the middle of each, painted white, then cut down two sheets of 12'x8' mdf with white vineer to the size of the panels, then attached 10 3D art panels to the front with construction adhesive (19.6" squars 2 tall by 5 wide). Those completed panels were secured to the desk with 4" L Brackets and to the wall at the top with Lag bolts.
I also reinforced the underside of the 98" Karlby with 2 steel U-channel beams to prevent sagging. Also added 2 legs from IKEA towards the back. No way this is going to sag.

I want to upgrade my case to the white Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL ROG Tempered Glass eATX Full Tower with 6 Fans: Corsair LL120 RGB, AIO: Corsair iCue H150i Elite Capellix CPU Cooler LGA 1700 white, 64GB Ram with RGB, Cable Estentions in white or RGB. New Desk Chair in white or grey. More plants with white vases. a few high shelfs in walnut to tie in with desk and break up just white.
